\chapter*{Thesis summary}
Exoplanet detection and characterization have long been treated as disparate and somewhat independent activities for direct imaging. 
In reality characterization of an exoplanet has been conducted as a follow up to a confirmed detection.
Characterization is typically carried out by comparing spectral features in a simulated exoplanet to the features present \@
in the data.
Detection on the other hand, for direct imaging requires the separation of several point like sources in the images as planet\@
and non planet candidates.
The non planet point like sources are typically named speckles. 
To improve this separation a method was suggested to combine spectral and spatial data, in essence combining the detection 
and characterization step.
This has been made possible with the presence of Integral Field Spectrographs (IFS) and the next generation of adapative optics based 
telescopes.
While telescopes have improved and the IFS allows us to extract spectra from every pixel in the telescope's field of view, there is still 
limited post processing that allows us to make subtle distinctions between speckles and exoplanets.
Despite this we have had a plethora of data that has been generated by these instruments, thus data processing itself is complex and requires 
large computing power.
It is in this context that my thesis is situated.

This thesis aims to combine high contrast imaging data with spectroscopic observations and thus create a unified framework to simulataneously,
detect and characterize an exoplanet candidate.
In order to do this we rely on three important pillars,
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Availability of high quality spectra that can be used to discriminate between speckles and exoplanets.
    \item a framework to combine these spectra to high contrast images that does not fully lie in the image or spectral domain alone, and
    \item a set of well tuned post processing algorithms that are correctly benchmarked.
\end{enumerate}
In this regard, my thesis is thus divided into three parts that focus on one of these pillars specifically.
